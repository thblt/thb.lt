Restarting this website, mostly to put a bunch of stuff that don't
have a place elsewhere.  This is meant as a place to collect a few
things I've done, among which you may be interested in:

 - [Write Yourself a Git!](https://wyag.thb.lt/), a learn-by-doing git
   tutorial where you learn git fundamentals by reimplementing git.
 - [`sway.el`](https://github.com/thblt/sway.el), an Emacs
   communication library to the Sway window manager.
 - [`pgp-words`](https://github.com/thblt/pgp-words.rs/), a Rust
   implementation of the PGP Word List.
 - More anecdotal things are on my
   [GitHub](https://github.com/thblt/).
 - [My PGP key can be found here](/pgp/).  I mostly use this for
   signing commits and authenticating to SSH servers.  If you need to
   give me access to some server, just authorize all the `A` subkeys.
   There are encryption subkeys as well, so I guess you can send me
   encrypted e-mail, too, if you feel like it.  If you want to
   doublecheck, its fingerprint is
   `D2A2F0A1E7A85E6FB711DEE563A44817A52EAB7B` (in pgp-words: *standard
   Pacific unearth outfielder / transit paramount eyeglass hemisphere
   / seabird Babylon tactics travesty / flatfoot Pandora deadbolt
   bookseller / reindeer coherence rhythm inferno*)
 - Notes and drafts, of probably very limited interest, can be found
   in [this page](/wiki).
