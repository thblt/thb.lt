## `layouts` in `info.json` and macro arguments order

 - Thibault: Speaking of layouts in info.json, how is the argument
order in the generated layout macro decided? Is it geographical, or
just the same order keys were declared? Can't find it in the docs
 - honorless: same order keys are declared
 - Thibault: So x, y are just for
visualisation purposes?
 - casuanoob: For when you run qmk info with the flag that shows the
layout casuanoob: And for Configurator to generate the image probably
- Thibault: Great, thanks!
